Synth-ReID
===========
Synthetic-to-Real Domain Transfer with Joint Image Translation and Discriminative Learning for Pedestrian Re-Identification.

This is the master thesis project for the Master's Degree in Data Science and Engineering at Politecnico di torino. It completes the previous [internship](https://github.com/RoboTuan/GTASynthReid) as both works were completed at the Links Foundation.  
The objective was to generalize from our dataset [GTASynthReid](https://github.com/RoboTuan/GTASynthReid) to real-world person re-identification data using a generative framework. We employed the *contrastive unpaired translation* framework for image translation
